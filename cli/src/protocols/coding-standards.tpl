# Generated: {TODAY}

# Philosophy: Code is for humans first, machines second
# RFC 2119: For RoyalBit, SHOULD = MUST (best practice = we do it)

philosophy: "Human-readable, beautiful, well-formatted code"

junior_warning: |
  Without these rules, you are a JUNIOR programmer - but super fast one...
  that creates tons of ugly, unmaintainable code for humans at high velocity!

rfc2119:
  MUST: "We follow (obviously)"
  SHOULD: "We follow (best practice = we do it)"
  MAY: "We don't care (no opinion needed, zero bikeshedding)"

principles:
  - "Code is for humans first, machines second"
  - "Tests are documentation"
  - "No warnings, no exceptions"
  - "Done > Perfect, but not sloppy"

rule: "See project.yaml coding_standards section for project-specific rules"
