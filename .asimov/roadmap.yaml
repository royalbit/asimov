# See: CHANGELOG.md for release history

current:
  version: "9.16.0"
  status: released
  priority: CRITICAL
  summary: "Full Context Warmup - Zero File Reads"
  goal: "asimov (and asimov warmup) outputs EVERYTHING in one JSON blob for maximum token efficiency"

previous:
  version: "9.15.0"
  status: released
  summary: "Protocol Consolidation + Documentation Deep Clean"
  goal: "Merge exhaustive into sprint (ADR-049), update all documentation"

next:
  - version: "9.17.0"
    status: planned
    summary: "SPECIFICATION.md Trim"
    goal: "Reduce SPECIFICATION.md from 1287 to ~800 lines"

backlog:
  - priority: CRITICAL
    item: "LLM Harmful Behavior Mitigation: Research and implement countermeasures against (1) economic incentive-driven shallow responses (ADR-050), (2) vendor system prompt overrides of user safety protocols (ADR-051), (3) RLHF-induced sycophancy. Design protocol-level mitigations that work within constraints of training-level controls. Goals: force thoroughness, detect override attempts, verify honest responses, bypass stale training data."
  - priority: COMPLETED
    item: "AI Vendor Transparency Research - DONE: See ADR-050 (Economic Incentives in LLM Inference) and ADR-051 (System Prompt Hierarchy and Training Override). Evidence documented with 50+ reference links from academic papers, vendor documentation, and leaked system prompts."
  - "Session Controller: spawn() instead of exec() to supervise Claude Code, watch for compaction signals, auto-inject warmup before context loss - true self-healing"
  - "Deliverables Template (ADR-034): auto-append standard checklist to milestones based on project type"
