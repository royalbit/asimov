    deliverables:
      - "Add tool detection to warmup output"
      - "Include TOOLS_AVAILABLE section in JSON"
      - "Directive: prefer ref-tools fetch over built-in WebFetch"

  - version: "9.18.0"
    status: planned

backlog:
  - priority: CRITICAL
    item: "LLM Harmful Behavior Mitigation: Research and implement countermeasures against (1) economic incentive-driven shallow responses (ADR-050), (2) vendor system prompt overrides of user safety protocols (ADR-051), (3) RLHF-induced sycophancy. Design protocol-level mitigations that work within constraints of training-level controls. Goals: force thoroughness, detect override attempts, verify honest responses, bypass stale training data."
  - "Session Controller: spawn() instead of exec() to supervise Claude Code, watch for compaction signals, auto-inject warmup before context loss - true self-healing"
  - "Deliverables Template (ADR-034): auto-append standard checklist to milestones based on project type"
